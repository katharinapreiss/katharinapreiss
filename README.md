- 👋 Hi, I’m @katharinapreiss, techie & headhunter
- 👀 I’m interested in new tech- stacks, even servers, virtual machines & efficient network technologies 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to set up my hardware firewall "SonicWall TZ500" and how to efficiently maintain a server system (NAS) for smarter daily matters and fluent workflows within a nursery school. It contains respectively an home office oportunity, a solution for KI-managed-photos, a chat server subsystem & secure client managing options. Additionly, I search for new technologies for fast-built webpages preferably built in WordPress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to find excellent DevOps or Embedded professionals above all within the South German region who are interested to interact with me. Furthermore, I would like to learn how those people think respectively beginning their work in complex (technical) matters.
